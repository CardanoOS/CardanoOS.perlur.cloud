# Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol

[Cardano Blockchain]() currently runs Ouroboros Praos version of Ouroboros series of Proof of Stake consensus protocols, this version of Ouroboros uses [Verifiable Random Function](Verifiable-Random-Function.md) in order to hide the identity of next block-producer, which brings it's own issues, however, Ouroboros Omega is being planned as an upgrade for the Cardano consensus protocol, incorporating ideas from **Ouroboros Genesis** and **Ouroboros Chronos**.
