**openSUSE Leap** uses source and newly also binaries from SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), which gives Leap a level of stability unmatched by other Linux distributions, and combines that with community developments to give users, developers and sysadmins the best stable Linux experience available.

Contributor and enterprise efforts for Leap bridge a gap between matured packages and newer packages found in other distribution [**openSUSE Tumbleweed**](openSUSE-Tumbleweed.md).
