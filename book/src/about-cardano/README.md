# About Cardano Blockchain

[Cardano](https://cardano.org/) is a power efficient 3rd generation blockchain built from first principles by worlds leading scientists and engineers; it's ecosystem was bootstraped by three entities listed below, however as we enter Basho and Voltaire eras of The 2020 Roadmap which was a little bit delayed, more and more companies are becoming core contributores, here are some notable ones:

## Founding Entities
- [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)
- [Input Output Global](https://iog.io/) (formely [Input Output HK](https://iohk.io/))
- [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/)

## Input Output Global Strategic Partners
- [dcSpark](https://www.dcspark.io/)
- [FiveBinaries](https://fivebinaries.com/)
- [Vacuumlabs](https://vacuumlabs.com/)
- [Well-Typed](https://www.well-typed.com/)

### Why is it power-efficient?
Cardano uses series of [Ouroboros Proof of Stake consensus protocols](./About-Cardano/Ouroboros-Proof-of-Stake.md) in an attempt to build a scientifically sound Proof of Stake consensus, hence Cardano Node can run on a low-power device such as Raspberry Pi, or [Turris Omnia](https://www.turris.com/en/omnia/overview/) Cardano eddition as soon as a 64-bit model of Turris Omnia gets released before the end of this year.
