# About TASSIC

Developed by a Czech company [Tropic Square](https://tropicsquare.com/), **TASSIC** is *The Transparent Authenticated Secure Storage Integrated Circuit*, basically an open source version of the secure element that Ledger is using.

The Transparent Authenticated Secure Storage Integrated Circuit, TASSIC in short, is the first custom chip (ASIC) we are working on at Tropic Square.

TASSIC is a minimalistic implementation of fundamental functionality - secure storage and associated cryptography to securely store digital data.

**TASSIC** will be available in several form factors, including a form factor that will be easy to [plug-in to your Trezor Model T](../about-Trezor/#trezor-model-t). In addition to that, **TASSIC** can be added to [Turris Omnia 2022](../about-Turris/Turris-Omnia-2022.md), which we can call Cardano edition when it will be powered by openSUSE MicroOS with transactional updates which will replace [OpenWRT based Turris OS](https://www.turris.com/en/turris-os/).

Previous versions of Turris Omnia have already been running [openSUSE](../../about-openSUSE/) already, including [Turris MOX](https://www.turris.com/en/mox/overview/) which is more lego-like version of [Turris](../about-Turris/).
