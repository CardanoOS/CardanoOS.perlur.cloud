# What is Cardano OS?

Cardano OS is a Linux based operating system that aims to integrate The Financial and Social Operating System of The World (Cardano) with [openSUSE Linux-based computer operating system](./about-openSUSE/). In this mutually beneficial partnership both Cardano and openSUSE communities will benefit thru leveraging synergetic aliances.

## About Cardano Blockchain
[Cardano](https://cardano.org/) is a power efficient 3rd generation blockchain built from first principles by worlds leading scientists and engineers; it's ecosystem was bootstraped by three entities:
- [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)
- [Input Output Global](https://iog.io/) (formely [Input Output HK](https://iohk.io/))
- [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/)

### What makes Cardano Blockchain stand out
[Cardano](about-cardano/README.md) has been designed from first principles applying lessons learned primarily from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Few things that stand out would be:
- [Energy efficient and provably secure Proof of Stake consensus](about-cardano/Ouroboros-Proof-of-Stake/)
- [The Extended UTXO Model](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/the-extended-utxo-model/)
- [The Plutus Platform Smart Contracts](https://docs.cardano.org/plutus/learn-about-plutus) â€” Based on Haskell which has a long history of usage in high-assurance applications, Plutus enables smart-contract developers write more secure smart contracts by reuse of already available tooling and ecosystem of companies.

## What are other streams?

### Open Source Hardware
Czech company called [CZ.NIC](https://www.nic.cz/), the maintainer of the `.cz` top-level domain name develops open-source series of routers called [Turris](https://www.turris.com/en/), currently these devices run custome version of [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) called [TurrisOS](https://www.turris.com/en/turris-os/) which is too light-weight.

However during 2022 a new version of their flag ship product, [Turris Omnia](about-hardware/Turris-Omnia.md) should be released with sufficient horse power become the ultimate home-appliance for Cardano community members.
